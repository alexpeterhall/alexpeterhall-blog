This is easy to do but I've already forgotten how since last time so I'm noting the steps here.

**Pre-Requisite** A React app that is pushed to a GitHub repository under your account.

1. Navigate to the root directory of your React App in a terminal and run the line below to install [gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages) as a development dependency in your React project.

```js
npm install gh-pages --save-dev
```

2. Open your package.json file and add a "homepage" property with the URL to the GitHub Page where this app will live. **Note:** The URL is not to the repo itself at GitHub.com but to the GitHub Page at {username}.github.io/{repo}.

```js
"homepage": "https://{username}.github.io/{repo-name}"
```

3. Also in your package.json add the below lines under the `scripts` property. Note, the argument sent to `gh-pages -d` should correspond to the output directory of your compiled app. Commonly used names are build, dist, output, etc.

```js
"predeploy": "npm run build"
"deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
```

4. Run `npm run deploy` in your terminal.

This creates a new branch in your repository called 'gh-pages'. The live version of the app on GitHub Pages refers to this branch. You can now go to the homepage URL you referenced above and see your app in action.

**House Keeping:** Commit and Push these changes to your repo.

**Future Changes:** If you make changes to your app you'll need to run `npm run deploy` to deploy the latest app to the `gh-pages` branch in your repo. Pushing changes directly to your `master` branch will not make those changes live on GitHub Pages.
