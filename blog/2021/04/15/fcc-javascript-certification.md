I know this is trivial, but I'm happy that I finally completed the freeCodeCamp [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/) course. I started this course (and others) years ago and had already finished most of it. I just had to finish up the "Intermediate Algorithm Scripting" module and final 5 "project" questions which I found surprisingly easy. I had fun solving these problems. It was good practice for coding interviews where you solve the same types of problems in the same environment. Minus the time constraints and other pressure!

I have a couple of questions I recently wrote down to help keep me focused. One is simply, **"What can I finish?"**. This course was one of the things I wanted to finish. The other is, **"What is the best thing you could be working on, and why aren't you?"**. With that in mind, I'm going to hold off working on any other freeCodeCamp courses for now. I don't like leaving things half-finished, but I don't think they are the best thing I could be working on right now. My primary focus is working on React apps and I don't want to get bogged down in tutorials. I'll eventually come back and finish up the [Front End Development Libraries](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/) course, but for now, it's on the back burner.
