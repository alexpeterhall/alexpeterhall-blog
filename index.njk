<h1 align="center">Hi! I'm Alex.</h1>

<p align="center"><img src="/img/headshot.png" width="184" height="200" alt="Professional headshot of Alex Hall" /></p>

<p>I have been building websites since I was a kid when Angelfire/Geocities sites and dial-up internet were all the rage. I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Information Systems from <a href="https://www.rwu.edu/">Roger Williams University</a> in 2009 where I developed a passion for website and software development. I am currently looking for new opportunities and I am excited to join a collaborative team where I can make an impact with test automation!</p>

<p>For the past year and a half, I have worked for a small remote company as a Software Development Engineer in Test. In this role, I built an automation framework using TypeScript and WebdriverIO to enable automating multiple implementations of a custom web application. I also helped integrate automated testing into the continuous integration build pipeline. Before that, I was fortunate to have worked in quality assurance, operations, and test automation for 11 years at a Fortune 50 company. </p>

<p>I like to read and I am always learning something new. I am currently fascinated with philosophy, psychology, and leadership. I also like disc golf, riding motorcycles, watches, playing classical violin, and collecting more hobbies than I have time for.</p>
