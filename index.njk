<h1 align="center">Hi! I'm Alex.</h1>

<p align="center"><img src="/img/headshot.png" width="184" height="200" alt="Professional headshot of Alex Hall" /></p>

<p>I have been building websites since I was a kid and Angelfire/Geocities sites and dial-up internet were all the rage. I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Information Systems from <a href="https://www.rwu.edu/">Roger Williams University</a> in 2009 where I developed a passion for website and software development</p>

<p>I have been fortunate to work in quality assurance, test automation, and operations over the past 11 years at a Fortune 50 company. However, I'm excited to have recently joined a much smaller company as a Software Development Engineer in Test. In my new role, I'm focusing on building test automation and helping to mature the continuous integration and continuous delivery process of the team.</p>

<p>I like to read and I'm always learning something new. I am currently fascinated with philosophy, leadership, and psychology. I also like riding motorcycles, playing classical violin, and collecting more hobbies than I have time for.</p>
